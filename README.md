# Clip Thumbnailer for Gnome Files
This is a thumbnailer for .clip files, generated by Clip Studio Paint, for Gnome Files and compatible file browsers.

The main files should be installed using the following command:

```
install -m 755 clipthumb clip_mkthumb.sh /usr/local/bin ; install -m 755 gnome-clip-thumbnailer.thumbnailer /usr/share/thumbnailers
```

The imagemagick and sqlite dependencies should be installed too.
Depending on your distro, the commands to use will be different:

### Ubuntu/Debian
```
sudo apt install imagemagick libsqlite3-dev
```

### Fedora
```
sudo dnf install imagemagick sqlite-devel
```

### Arch
```
sudo pacman -S imagemagick sqlite
```
